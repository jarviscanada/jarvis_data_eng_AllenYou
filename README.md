# Allen You . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Ryerson University with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Computer Science. During my education, I studied software engineering, database systems, data mining and the fundamentals of coding languages. I enjoy solving coding problems and creating software. During school the languages I got to work with are Java, C+/C , PHP, SQL and Bash. I was able to work with these languages by completing school projects. Currently, I am a software developer at Jarvis Consulting Group. At Jarvis, I am developing my skill sets using agile software development practices and working hands-on with applications of new technologies (Docker, REST APIs, Springboot, etc.).

## Skills

**Proficient:** Java, RDBMS/SQL, Bash, Agile/Scrum, Git

**Competent:** Docker, PHP, Javascript, Data Structures, Maven

**Familiar:** C/C++, HTML/CSS, Python, HTTP/JSON, JUnit

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AllenYou](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AllenYou)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AllenYou/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a cluster monitoring system that records the hardware and resource usage of each host in a system. This script is used by the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to manage a Linux cluster running on CentOS 7. Data collected include the host's CPU number, total memory, memory free, disk I/O, CPU MHz and more, which are recorded to a PostgresSQL Docker RDBMS database every minute using a bash script running through crontab.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AllenYou/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - **JDBC App:** Implemented a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) application, which is used to create a connection to a PostgreSQL database. The application allows for the client to perform predefined operations to the database, such as CRUD (create, read, update, delete). The project uses Java, JDBC, Maven, SQL, Docker and PostgreSQL.
  - **Grep App:** Implemented a Java Grep App is made to replicate the Linux grep command, searching files in a directory and matching strings to within the files. It implements Maven, Stream APIs, Regex and Lambda and is tested using the main method and JUnit testing. The application is contained in a Docker container.


## Highlighted Projects
**Web App For Car Rental Service**: Worked in a group as a full stack developer using HTML, Angular, PHP, MySQL. The app focus was to be a user friendly app where one can sign up and purchase rentals for specific time and dates. Team coordination efforts include Github and daily meetings involving design review and implementation assigments.

**CACM Document Retrieval Application**: Created a Java program that finds the most relevant document in a collection of over 3000 documents ([the CACM collection](http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/cacm/)). Preprocessed queries to filter stop words, stem words and non-alphanumeric values and stored document frequency, term frequency, position and document ID for every term. This information was then used to score the document relevancy for any user query to find the most relevant documents.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2022-present)**: Worked in a team of software developers in an Agile/Scrum work environment. This included daily scrum meetings and the opportunity to be a team lead for one two-week sprint. The team lead role contained responsibilities such as leading daily scrum meetings. Worked with technologies such as PostgreSQL, Docker, Maven, APIs and Git.
